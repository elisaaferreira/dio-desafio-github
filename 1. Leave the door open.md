# 1. Leave the door Open - Bruno Mars

Said baby, said baby, said baby

What you doin'? (What you doin'?)
Where you at? (Where you at?)
Oh, you got plans? (You got plans)
Don't say that (shut your trap)
I'm sippin' wine (sip, sip) in a robe (drip, drip)
I look too good (look too good)
To be alone (woo, woo)
My house clean (house clean), my pool warm (pool warm)
Just shaved, smooth like a newborn
We should be dancin', romancin'
In the east wing and the west wing
Of this mansion, what's happenin'?

I ain't playin' no games
Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart
So if you tryna lay in these arms

I'ma leave the door open
(I'ma leave the door open)
I'ma leave the door open, girl
(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')
That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
Tell me that you’re coming through

You're so sweet (so sweet), so tight (so tight)
I won't bite (ah-ah), unless you like (unless you like)
If you smoke (what you smoke?) I got the haze (purple haze)
And if you're hungry, girl, I got filets (woo)
Oh, baby, don't keep me waitin'
There's so much love we could be making (shamone!)
I'm talking kissing, cuddling
Rose petals in the bathtub
Girl, let's jump in, it's bubblin'

I ain't playin' no games
Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart
So if you tryna lay in these arms

I'ma leave the door open
(I'ma leave the door open)
I'ma leave the door open, girl
(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')
That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
Tell me that you’re coming through (oh, girl)

La-la-la-la-la-la-la (I need you, baby)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (I gotta see you, baby)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (girl, I'm tryna give you this, ah)

Hey, hey, I'ma leave my door open, baby
(I'ma leave the door open)
I'ma leave, I'ma leave my door open, girl
(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')
And I'm hopin', hopin'
That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
Tell me that you’re coming through (woo!)

La-la-la-la-la-la-la (tell me)
Tell me that you're coming through
(Woo-woo-woo-woo, woo-woo-woo, woo-woo-woo)
(Woo-woo-woo-woo, woo-woo-woo, woo-woo)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (la-la-la-la-la)
Tell me that you're coming through
Girl, I'm here just waiting for you (oh!)
Come on over, I'll adore you (I gotta know!)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (I'm waiting, waiting, waiting)
Tell me that you're coming through (for you)
Girl, I'm here just waiting for you
Come on over, I'll adore you
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
